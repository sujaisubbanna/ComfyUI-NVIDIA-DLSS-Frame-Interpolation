# ComfyUI NVIDIA DLSS 5 Visual Enhancer

Native NVIDIA DLSS processing for ordered ComfyUI `IMAGE` batches. This release
has two nodes, both designed to connect directly to image-producing nodes such
as **VAE Decode** (including MiniMax workflows):

- **NVIDIA DLSS Image Frame Interpolation** — `IMAGE` batch → higher-rate `IMAGE` batch.
- **NVIDIA DLSS Image Sequence Upscale** — `IMAGE` batch → larger `IMAGE` batch.

```text
VAE Decode -> NVIDIA DLSS Image Frame Interpolation -> Video Combine / Save Image
VAE Decode -> NVIDIA DLSS Image Sequence Upscale   -> Video Combine / Save Image
```

The nodes never encode a container or write a temporary video. They retain the
frame order in memory, so a downstream ComfyUI node remains responsible for
encoding, audio, subtitles, timing metadata, and the permanent output path.

## Breaking workflow migration

This version intentionally retires the previous `VIDEO` input/output nodes.
Replace each old node with its `IMAGE` counterpart, route the ordered batch
from **VAE Decode** (or another image source) into it, and place your chosen
video-combine node after the DLSS node. Frame interpolation now has an explicit
**Input FPS** control because an `IMAGE` batch has no embedded timing metadata.

Existing workflows using `NvidiaDLSSFrameInterpolation` or
`NvidiaDLSSVideoUpscale` need to be rebuilt; retaining their identifiers would
silently reinterpret a `VIDEO` workflow as image data.

## Requirements

- A current ComfyUI installation.
- A compatible NVIDIA RTX GPU and current NVIDIA display driver.
- Windows, or Linux x86-64 with Wine (experimental).
- Git LFS for source clones, because the bundled runtime binaries use LFS.

The custom node includes the DLSS runtimes, RenoDX/ReShade carrier, and worker
executables. Current ComfyUI supplies Python dependencies including PyTorch,
NumPy, and OpenCV. FFmpeg is only required by the downstream node that encodes
your output images into video.

## Installation

1. Clone with Git LFS, or install a complete release archive:

   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/Konohamaru04/ComfyUI-NVIDIA-DLSS-Frame-Interpolation.git
   cd ComfyUI-NVIDIA-DLSS-Frame-Interpolation
   git lfs pull
   ```

2. Restart ComfyUI.

3. On Linux, run the [setup helper](docs/linux.md#setup-helper-recommended)
   once, then launch ComfyUI normally. It saves the Wine worker configuration
   in `linux-runtime.json`; a separate launch script is not needed.

## NVIDIA DLSS Image Frame Interpolation

Connect an ordered batch with at least two frames. Choose the real source rate
with **Input FPS**, then select **Output FPS** and a DLSS engine. Fractional
choices use exact 1001-based rates. The output is a new `IMAGE` batch on the
requested constant-rate timeline.

| Control | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Input FPS | Rate of the ordered input images. VAE Decode does not provide this itself. |
| Output FPS | `23.976` through `120`; target must not exceed 6× input rate. |
| DLSS Engine | `Auto` uses native DLSSG where its grid is exact, otherwise it cascades 2× stages. |

`report_json` records input/output counts, copied/generated frames, timing
error, scene-cut resets, chosen plan, and detected GPU/runtime capability.

## NVIDIA DLSS Image Sequence Upscale

This node processes every image in order and returns an upscaled `IMAGE` batch.
It keeps temporal guide history across frames instead of resetting the DLSS
session for every image. A single frame is valid; a batch receives temporal
guides from its preceding images.

- RGB input returns RGB output.
- RGBA input returns RGBA output, with alpha resized using Lanczos.
- Single-channel input returns RGB output.
- Every input image must be at least 64×64 pixels.

Upscale modes range from `1x (DLAA / native)` through `3x (Ultra Performance)`.
The node exposes the DLSS Neural Rendering controls: preset, style, intensity,
tone/structure controls, automatic mask, model preset, and optional SDR output
detail strength.

### Neural-upscaling status

Read the `report_json` fields rather than treating larger dimensions as proof
of neural Super Resolution:

- `feature_18_confirmed` means the signed DLSS Neural Rendering feature ran.
- `nr_upscaling_active` means it accepted the lower-resolution neural-upscale contract.
- `nr_native_fallback` means that contract was rejected and NR ran at output
  resolution after the carrier's DLSS SR pass.

**Require Neural Upscaling** changes this into a strict pass/fail check. It
does not make an unsupported driver/runtime path active.

## Linux

Follow the detailed [Linux guide](docs/linux.md). It documents a dedicated
Wine prefix with GE-Proton, DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, DXVK-NVAPI, the native shader
compiler, NVIDIA's Wine NGX bridge, and the patched Linux ReShade carrier.

The setup was tested on CachyOS with an RTX 5090, NVIDIA driver **610.57.04**,
and GE-Proton 11-6. Native/cascaded IMAGE frame interpolation and image-sequence
NR succeeded. On that driver, direct NR upscaling returns `0xBAD00005`; the
supported fallback runs DLSS SR followed by native-resolution NR and reports
`nr_native_fallback: true`. Leave **Require Neural Upscaling** off to accept
that fallback, or enable it when your workflow must reject it.

## Validation

The test suite covers deterministic IMAGE-timeline selection, cancellation,
temporal image-sequence upscaling, and opt-in GPU tests through the actual
ComfyUI node entry points. The GPU test feeds a synthetic ordered `IMAGE` batch
through 30→60 FPS interpolation and 1.5× Cinematic sequence upscale, then
checks output tensor dimensions, finite values, feature-18 evidence, and
fallback status.

Run all non-GPU tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

With configured Linux workers and ComfyUI's Python environment, run the real
Comfy node test:

```bash
DLSS_COMFYUI_PATH="$HOME/ComfyUI" DLSS_RUN_COMFY_GPU_TESTS=1 \
  "$HOME/ComfyUI/.venv/bin/python" -m unittest discover \
  -s tests -p 'test_comfy_gpu.py'
```
